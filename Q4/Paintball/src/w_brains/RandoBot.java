/**
 * One of the "dumb" strategies provided with the Paintball program. RandoBot
 * selects one of the four basic moves at random. If the move requires a direction,
 * that is selected at random as well.<p>
 * The method used for Action selection is a weighted-random approach. Each
 * individual choice has a weight, which is a nonnegative integer. The probability
 * that a given Action is chosen is given by (weight of that Action)/(total weight
 * of all actions).<p>
 * To give an analogy, say that the weightings are 3 for shoot, 5 for move,
 * and 3 for turn. Imagine that there are 3 slips of paper with "shoot" written
 * on them, 5 with "move", and 3 with "turn". One of these slips is chosen at
 * random and the action is taken. Note that if the RandoBot cannot shoot at this
 * time, the slips marked "shoot" are not used.
