/**
 * The smartest of the "dumb" strategies provided with the software. This rudimentary
 * strategy attempts to shoot the opponent's base as often as possible. Since it
 * makes absolutely no attempt to avoid being shot, it tends to get shot easily.
 * Its basic strategy looks like this:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If next to opponent's base and pointing at it, shoot.</li>
 * <li>2. If next to opponent's base and not pointing at it, turn towards it.</li>
 * <li>3. If not next to opponent's base, move towards it, but if the space between
 * the DumbBaseCharger and the opponent's base is occupied, move in a random
 * direction.</li>
 * </ol>
